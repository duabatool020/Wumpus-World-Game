# Wumpus-World-Game
This Program will Solve the problem given below in python:<br>
Develop a model based agent for the wumpus world shown in the image below. The agent
has to find the gold while updating the state of the world after every action. Consider the
wumpus world as deterministic and partially observable.<br>
<b>Goal:</b> To find the gold and then to go back safely (avoiding pit and wumpus) to its starting
location.<br>
<b>Percepts:</b> pit, gold, empty, wumpus (can have percept of just one block ahead)<br>
<b>Actions:</b> Grab gold, move left, move right, move up, move down, and do nothing.<br>
You will need a class for Agent. It might be useful to define a list of nested lists depicting
which blocks are adjacent to each block (in order to limit percepts to one block ahead in each
adjacent direction) and update states accordingly.<br>
First agent will check state, find out which block he's in.<br>
If block has gold, agent gets the current Action 'Grab gold', then Grabs Gold, then returns
to starting position.<br>
Otherwise, then agent will look at one block ahead (either up, down, left, right) and get
percept. Then agent will update state according to that block & percepts and decide action
Repeat steps until agent gets to gold or exhausts maximum steps =50<br>
When looking for gold, if action is DO NOTHING then return failure and stop execution
(this means that all adjacent blocks have either wumpus or pits.)<br>
Return success if and only if agent finds gold, grabs gold, AND returns to starting position
successfully<br>
Print current position of agent as well as state after each repetition. You may find it useful
to use input() function to prompt user after every repetition so that the output doesnâ€˜t flash
by too fast and can be viewed by us.<br>

At some stage, if needed, you may also use the built-in random module to randomise the order
in which you access adjacent block percepts. The random.shuffle (list_as_an_argument)
function might come in handy.
